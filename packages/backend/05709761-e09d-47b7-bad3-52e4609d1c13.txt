        "content": "CNNs are a type of artificial neural network designed for image recognition and processing. They typically have three layers: convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layer performs dot products between matrices, with one matrix being learnable parameters (kernel) and the other a restricted portion of the image. This produces an activation map, a 2D representation of the image. The pooling layer summarizes nearby outputs, reducing the spatial size. The fully connected layer, a feedforward neural network, performs classification based on extracted features. Activation functions like ReLu and softmax aid training and prediction.",

Region-based CNN (R-CNN) is a two-stage pipeline that uses selective search to generate region proposals and then classifies objects within these regions. Fast R-CNN improves speed by generating a feature map first and then classifying region proposals. Faster R-CNN eliminates selective search, using a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to learn region proposals directly from the feature map. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art algorithm that divides the image into grids and predicts boundary boxes and class probabilities.
