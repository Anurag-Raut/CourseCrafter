    "topicName": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Object Detection Algorithms",
    "content": "CNNs are a type of artificial neural network designed for image recognition and processing. They typically have three layers: convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layer performs dot products between matrices, including learnable parameters (kernels) and portions of the image (receptive fields). This produces activation maps that represent the kernel's response across the image. The pooling layer reduces the spatial size of the representation while retaining important features. The fully connected layer, similar to feedforward neural networks (FNN), performs classification based on extracted features. Activation functions like ReLu and softmax are used for training and prediction. CNNs have applications in object detection, semantic segmentation, and image captioning.\n\nObject detection algorithms include R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and YOLO. R-CNN uses a two-stage approach with selective search for region proposals and CNN for classification. Fast R-CNN improves speed by generating a feature map first and then classifying region proposals. Faster R-CNN introduces a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to learn region proposals, eliminating the need for selective search. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art algorithm that divides the image into grids and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities. It's a simple regression problem with applications in object detection and localization.",
